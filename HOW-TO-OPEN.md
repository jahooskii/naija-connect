# 🚀 How to Open Naija Connect

## Quick Access Files

You now have 3 HTML shortcut files in this folder:

### 1️⃣ **Open-Main-App.html**
- Opens the main customer marketplace
- URL: http://localhost:8000
- For: Customers browsing and booking services

### 2️⃣ **Open-Provider-Dashboard.html**
- Opens the provider dashboard
- URL: http://localhost:8000/provider
- For: Service providers managing their services and bookings
- Login required (provider account)

### 3️⃣ **Open-Admin-Dashboard.html**
- Opens the admin control panel
- URL: http://localhost:8000/admin
- For: Platform administrators
- Credentials: username `admin`, password `admin123`

## How to Use

1. **Start the server** (if not running):
   ```bash
   cd ~/Desktop/naija-connect-app/backend
   python3 app.py
   ```

2. **Double-click** any of the HTML files above to open that dashboard

3. Your default browser will open automatically

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Server must be running first!**
- The HTML shortcuts only work when the Flask server is running
- If you see "can't connect" error, start the server first

✅ **Server Running Check:**
- Look for terminal output: "Running on http://127.0.0.1:8000"
- Or visit http://localhost:8000 in your browser

## Credentials

**Admin:**
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin123`

**Test Provider:**
- Username: `provider1`
- Password: `provider123`

**Or Register:** Create your own customer or provider account

## Need Help?

If the shortcuts don't work:
1. Make sure the server is running
2. Check that port 8000 is not blocked
3. Try copying the URL manually into your browser
4. Use Chrome or Firefox if Safari gives errors
